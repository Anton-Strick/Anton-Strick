- Hi, I’m @Anton-Strick
- I’m interested in embedded systems, game engine design, and robot control systems

Hello! Thanks for dropping by my Git page. My best work is consigned to the algorithmic-artisans org, which I created with friends to work on web applications powered by AWS, Babylon (the Type/JavaScript 3d Engine), and our ideas for what we look for in a tabletop board game companion.
